# **BWT Project for NGS**<br>

This code was built using a combination of R and Python to implement a Burrow-Wheeler Transform Algorithm as part of a Group Project for the NGS Module on the MSc. Bioinformatics program at the University of Birmingham, Dubai.<br>

It involves implementation of a forward BWT transform, a reverse and finally a calculator to check file sizes and ensure that the storage efficiency actually improves after applying the BWT.
